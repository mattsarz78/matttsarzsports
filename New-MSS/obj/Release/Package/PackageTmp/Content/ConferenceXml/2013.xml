        The ACC has a contract with ABC/ESPN for all of its football television rights.
        ESPN's broadband service, ESPN3.com, can also access games that are not slated for
        telecast.  This contract begins with the 2011-12 athletic year and ends with
        the 2026-27 athletic year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Raycom is the syndication partner of the ACC and they sublicense their content from
        ESPN.  Raycom will manage both over-the-air and regional cable syndication
        packages. The regional cable package appears to have been sublicensed to FOX Sports
        Media Group for airing on some FSN affiliates, NESN and Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic.  Raycom&#39;s package of over-the air games are branded as the ACC Network. The ACC
        Network over-the-air telecasts will kickoff at 12:30pm ET, a change from prior seasons.
        ESPN is also able to sublicenese games to other national carriers.
      </p>
      <p>
        It does not appear that there are any limits/minimums in terms of number of games
        over a season for the ACC with their national TV contracts. The ACC is guaranteed
        a game on Labor Day by ESPN.
      </p>
      <p>
        To cover the additions of Syracuse and Pittsburgh to the conference, the ACC signed
        an extension with ESPN for more money per school, adding years to the deal that
        started with the 2011-12 athletic year. Items relevant to football include that
        the ACC will have up to three Friday night football games per season, one of those
        three to be played on Black Friday in the afternoon or evening. Specifically, Boston
        College and Syracuse will each host one Friday night game per year.

        The American Athletic Conference, formerly known as the Big East, has contracts
        with ABC for network TV, ESPN Networks for national cable and ESPN Regional Television
        for regional syndication. In order of preference, ABC gets first choice, followed
        by ESPN Networks, then ESPN Regional TV. ESPN&#39;s broadband service, ESPN3, is
        also allowed to select games not chosen for television. This contract expires after
        the 2013 football season.  ABC/ESPN will guarantee the conference a minimum of 24 games to air on ABC, ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPNU.  
      </p>
      <p>
        One game (Norfolk St. at Rutgers) has been sublicensed to CBS Sports Network. This
        was part of a deal made between ESPN and CBS Sports Network to allow ESPNU to carry
        the Rutgers at Fresno St. game on 8/29.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conference and ESPN have agreed upon a new contract starting with the 2014-15
        athletic year. Per the conference, regional syndication packages and other local
        telecasts will disappear in favor of increased national exposure though various
        ESPN platforms. ESPN also has the ability to sublicense a limited number of American
        controlled games.

        The Big Ten has a contract with ESPN for 41 games and a regional TV contract with
        the Big Ten Network (BTN), a FOX Sports Media Group &amp; Big Ten joint venture. There
        were previously stipulations on the maximum number of games on ABC (17) and ESPN
        cable platforms (25), but those numbers have went away. Now the ESPN platforms have
        a total of 41 games that they can spread over ABC, ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPNU.
      </p>
      <p>
        For selection order, ABC has the first selection of games every week. Most weeks
        ESPN/ESPN2 will have the next set of game choices, followed by BTN. BTN will be
        able to leapfrog ESPN and/or ESPN2 on select weekends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting with 2011, ABC has given up exclusivity in the 3:30pm telecast window.
        BTN will now be allowed to schedule games during the 3:30pm time slot if it desires.
      </p>
      <p>
        FOX Sports, under a separate contract, has the rights to the conference championship
        game. These rights started in 2011 and will end after the 2016 championship game.

        The Big 12 a pair of contracts with ESPN and FOX Sports Media Group. Both contracts
        expire after the 2024-25 athletic year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ESPN deal allows for 19 games per year from 2012-2015, then 23 games starting
        in 2016. Games can air on ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU and Longhorn Network (Texas games
        only). FOX's deal is for up to 40 games per year to place games on FOX, FOX Sports One, FSN
        and FOX College Sports. A minimum of six of FSMG's games must appear on FOX. Overall,
        a minimum of 25 games must air on ABC, ESPN, F/X or FOX.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individual institutions will retain the rights to at least one game not aired by
        ABC or FSMG, allowing those institutions to explore other avenues to televising
        those games. Institutions can elect to return their institutional game to FOX for
        their package to televise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding Longhorn Network, one Texas game per year airing on the network counts
        as an institutional game, like all other Big 12 schools. Any subsequent Texas games
        airing on Longhorn Network will count towards the ESPN contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of the FSMG contract, up to three games can move to Thursdays and the network
        has the ability to place games on the Friday after Thanksgiving and Sunday of Labor
        Day weekend.

        The MWC has a pair of national cable contracts with CBS Sports Network and ESPN.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CBS contract was reconfigured and extended through the 2019-20 athletic year
        where the conference will control two packages of television rights that they can
        sell directly to third parties. CBS is considered to be the "primary" TV partner.
        CBS will be able to choose the top eight football games each year, the alternate
        with ESPN for the rest of their picks. This package is for up to 22 games. CBS is
        also negotiating with the conference for the rights to the MWC football championship
        game.
      </p>
      <p>
        ESPN's package also runs through the 2019-20 athletic year and includes the rights
        to Boise St. home games. At least three Boise St. football games will air on ABC,
        ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN can choose the platform of its choice for all other home games.
        No more than three Boise St. home games can be moved to a weeknight. ESPN will have
        up to 22 football games including the Boise St. home games. ESPN does have the ability
        to trade one Boise St. home game per year to CBS in exchange for a Boise St. road
        games at a MWC opponent. For 2013, ESPN traded the rights to Boise St.'s home game
        vs. Nevada in exchange for the rights to the Broncos' road game at Fresno St.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also in 2013, ESPN obtained the rights to a 23rd MWC game (Rutgers at Fresno St.).
        In exchange, ESPN sublicensed a Big East game involving Rutgers to CBS Sports Network.
      </p>
      <p>
        The official regional partner for the MWC is ROOT Sports Rocky Mountain, who will
        produce at least 10 football games annually. As of right now, it is unknown whether
        other regional networks will carry MWC games or simulcasting the ROOT Sports telecasts.

        a primetime game, CBS can choose the top two games on a given weekend.  When
        they do a doubleheader that includes a 12pm game, it must allow ESPN to reserve
