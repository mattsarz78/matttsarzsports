        The ACC has a contract with ABC/ESPN for all of its football television rights.
        ESPN's broadband service, ESPN3.com, can also access games that are not slated for
        telecast.  This contract begins with the 2011-12 athletic year and ends with
        the 2026-27 athletic year.

        Raycom is the syndication partner of the ACC and they sublicense their content from
        ESPN.  Raycom will manage both over-the-air and regional cable syndication
        packages. The regional cable package appears to have been sublicensed to FOX Sports
        Media Group for airing on some FSN affiliates, NESN and Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic.  Raycom&#39;s package of over-the air games are branded as the ACC Network. The ACC
        Network over-the-air telecasts will kickoff at 12:30pm ET, a change from prior seasons.
        ESPN is also able to sublicenese games to other national carriers.
      </p>
      <p>
        It does not appear that there are any limits/minimums in terms of number of games
        over a season for the ACC with their national TV contracts. The ACC is guaranteed
        a game on Labor Day by ESPN.
      </p>
      <p>
        To cover the additions of Syracuse and Pittsburgh to the conference, the ACC signed
        an extension with ESPN for more money per school, adding years to the deal that
        started with the 2011-12 athletic year. Items relevant to football include that
        the ACC will have up to three Friday night football games per season, one of those
        three to be played on Black Friday in the afternoon or evening. Specifically, Boston
        College and Syracuse will each host one Friday night game per year.

        The Big 12 a pair of contracts with ESPN and FOX Sports Media Group. Both contracts
        expire after the 2024-25 athletic year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ESPN deal allows for 19 games per year from 2012-2015, then 23 games starting
        in 2016. Games can air on ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU and Longhorn Network (see note below re: LHN). FOX's deal is for up to 40 games per year to place games on FOX, FOX Sports 1, FSN
        and FOX College Sports. A minimum of six of FSMG's games must appear on FOX with another six on FOX Sports 1. Overall,
        a minimum of 25 games must air on ABC, ESPN, FOX and FOX Sports 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individual institutions will retain the rights to at least one game not aired by
        ABC or FSMG, allowing those institutions to explore other avenues to televising
        those games. Institutions can elect to return their institutional game to FOX for
        their package to televise. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding Longhorn Network, one Texas game per year airing on the network counts
        as an institutional game, like all other Big 12 schools. Any subsequent Texas games
        airing on Longhorn Network will count towards the ESPN contract.

      </p>
      <p>
        The CBS contract was reconfigured and extended through the 2019-20 athletic year
        where the conference will control two packages of television rights that they can
        sell directly to third parties. CBS is considered to be the "primary" TV partner.
        CBS will be able to choose the top eight football games each year, then alternate
        with ESPN for the rest of their picks. This package is for up to 22 games. CBS has also picked up the rights to the conference championship game starting with 2013.  The contract is rumored to be for two years (2013 &amp; 2014) with an option for a third year.
      </p>
      <p>
        ESPN's package also runs through the 2019-20 athletic year and includes the rights
        to Boise St. home games. At least three Boise St. football games will air on ABC,
        ESPN, ESPN2.  ESPN can choose the platform of its choice for all other Boise St. home games.

        up to 22 football games including the Boise St. home games. ESPN does have the ability
        to trade one Boise St. home game per year to CBS in exchange for a Boise St. road
        games at a MWC opponent. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The official regional partner for the MWC is ROOT Sports Rocky Mountain, who will
        produce around 10 football games annually.  Campus Insiders also works with the conference to produce games that will be streamed through the Moutain West Digital Network.
      </p>
      <p>
      ESPN and CBS select up to two more games each once ROOT Sports and Campus Insiders select games for their packages, meaning ESPN and CBS could show up to 24 games.

      <p>Hawai'i does not receive money from the MW TV contract unless all other Mountain West schools receive $2.3 million from the conference TV contracts.

        a primetime game, CBS can choose the top two games on a given weekend.  When
        they do a doubleheader that includes a 12pm game, it must allow ESPN to reserve
        two games before selecting their next game.  In 2014, CBS will no longer retain exclusivity in their telecast windows.  The SEC Network will be allowed to air a game concurrently with CBS.
