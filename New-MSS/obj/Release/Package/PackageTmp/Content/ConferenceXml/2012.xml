        The ACC has a contract with ABC/ESPN for all of its football television rights.
        ESPN's broadband service, ESPN3.com, can also access games that are not slated for
        telecast.  This contract begins with the 2011-12 athletic year and ends with
        the 2026-27 athletic year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Raycom is the syndication partner of the ACC and they sublicense their content from
        ESPN.  Raycom will manage both over-the-air and regional cable syndication
        packages. The regional cable package appears to have been sublicensed to FOX Sports
        Media Group for airing on some FSN affiliates, NESN and Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic.  Raycom&#39;s package of over-the air games are branded as the ACC Network. The ACC
        Network over-the-air telecasts will kickoff at 12:30pm ET, a change from prior seasons.
        ESPN is also able to sublicenese games to other national carriers.
      </p>
      <p>
        It does not appear that there are any limits/minimums in terms of number of games
        over a season for the ACC with their national TV contracts. The ACC is guaranteed
        a game on Labor Day by ESPN.
      </p>
      <p>
        To cover the additions of Syracuse and Pittsburgh to the conference, the ACC signed
        an extension with ESPN for more money per school, adding years to the deal that
        started with the 2011-12 athletic year. Items relevant to football include that
        the ACC will have up to three Friday night football games per season, one of those
        three to be played on Black Friday in the afternoon or evening. Specifically, Boston
        College and Syracuse will each host one Friday night game per year.

        The Big Ten has a contract with ESPN for 41 games and a regional TV contract with
        the Big Ten Network (BTN), a FOX Sports Media Group &amp; Big Ten joint venture. There
        were previously stipulations on the maximum number of games on ABC (17) and ESPN
        cable platforms (25), but those numbers have went away. Now the ESPN platforms have
        a total of 41 games that they can spread over ABC, ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPNU.
      </p>
      <p>
        For selection order, ABC has the first selection of games every week. Most weeks
        ESPN/ESPN2 will have the next set of game choices, followed by BTN. BTN will be
        able to leapfrog ESPN and/or ESPN2 on select weekends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting with 2011, ABC has given up exclusivity in the 3:30pm telecast window.
        BTN will now be allowed to schedule games during the 3:30pm time slot if it desires.

      </p>
      <p>
        The ESPN deal allows for 19 games per year from 2012-2015, then 23 games starting
        in 2016. Games can air on ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU and Longhorn Network (Texas games
        only). FOX's deal is for up to 40 games per year to place games on FOX, F/X, FSN
        and FOX College Sports. A minimum of six of FSMG's games must appear on FOX. Overall,
        a minimum of 25 games must air on ABC, ESPN, F/X or FOX.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individual institutions will retain the rights to at least one game not aired by
        ABC or FSMG, allowing those institutions to explore other avenues to televising
        those games. Institutions can elect to return their institutional game to FOX for
        their package to televise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding Longhorn Network, one Texas game per year airing on the network counts
        as an institutional game, like all other Big 12 schools. Any subsequent Texas games
        airing on Longhorn Network will count towards the ESPN contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of the FSMG contract, up to three games can move to Thursdays and the network
        has the ability to place games on the Friday after Thanksgiving and Sunday of Labor

        choice of SEC games on a weekly basis.  When CBS does a doubleheader that includes
        a primetime game, CBS can choose the top two games on a given weekend.  When
        they do a doubleheader that includes a 12pm game, it must allow ESPN to reserve
        two games before selecting their next game.
