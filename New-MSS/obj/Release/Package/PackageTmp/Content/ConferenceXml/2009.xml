        over a season for the ACC with their national TV contracts. ABC/ESPN/ESPN2 televised
        a total of 31 regular season games each of the last two seasons, where 2005 had
        more games on ABC and 2006 had less. The ACC is guaranteed a game on Labor Day by
        ESPN and is set to appear as many as six times on Thursday nights on ESPN.
